        Hello, Iâ€™m Pragyan Sapkota, an enthusiastic learner and creator, always
        striving to grow and make a positive impact. Currently, Iâ€™m a grade 11
        student with a strong passion for programming, mathematics, creative
        arts. My journey has been fueled by curiosity and a desire to understand
        how things work, which has led me to explore exciting fields like
        coding, algorithms, and problem-solving.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond academics, I have a wide range of interests that keep me inspired
        and motivated. I love Coding,Playing games etc. These activities not
        only help me unwind but also provide fresh perspectives that I apply in
        my work and studies.
        <br />
        <br />
        This website is a reflection of who I am and what I stand for. Itâ€™s a
        platform where I share my projects, ideas, and experiences, hoping to
        connect with others who share similar interests. Whether it's showcasing
        my latest creations, writing about topics Iâ€™m passionate about, or
        simply sharing life updates, I aim to create a space that inspires and
        engages.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the things I enjoy most is collaborating with others and
        exchanging ideas. I firmly believe that learning is a lifelong journey,
        and every interaction is an opportunity to grow. If youâ€™re here, Iâ€™d
        love for you to explore my work, share your thoughts, and connect with
        me. Feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™m always open to discussions,
        collaborations, or even just a friendly chat!
        <br />
        <br />
        When Iâ€™m not immersed in work or studies, youâ€™ll likely find me [Fun
        Activity, e.g., binge-watching sci-fi movies, experimenting with new
        recipes in the kitchen, or trekking outdoors]. Iâ€™m also a huge fan of
        digital art, futuristic technology, classic literature, and Iâ€™m always
        on the lookout for new ideas and inspirations.
